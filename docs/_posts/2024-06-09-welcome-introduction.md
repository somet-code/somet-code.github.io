Welcome to the start of my website!

The discipline of meteorology is filled with visuals, like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/upperair/skew-t-log-p-diagrams">skew-T log-p diagrams</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://ocean.weather.gov/unified_analysis.php">surface weather maps</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/obswx/maps/">upper-air maps</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://weather.cod.edu/analysis/">cross-sections</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/us-climate-normals/">climographs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series">time series</a>, and more.

Meteorology majors gain experience with all these visuals through coursework, and they often practice on their own &mdash; even prior to entering the major!

I primary teach non-STEM majors who do not get such experience, and our visuals can be daunting, especially because many weather websites are made for professionals and hobbyists and therefore pack a lot of information into each figure.

I want to help my students and others with passing interest break down the visuals they see in other websites and in textbooks. For each type of visual, we'll start with the very basics and work our way to more advanced add-ons.

Eventually, I hope to create a full collection of tutorials!
